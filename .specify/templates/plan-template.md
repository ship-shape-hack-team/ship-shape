# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with all core principles from `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- [ ] **Evidence-Based Design**: All technical choices backed by research/citations
- [ ] **Measurable Quality**: Success criteria are quantifiable and testable
- [ ] **Tool-First Mindset**: Libraries before CLI, text-based I/O
- [ ] **Test-Driven Development**: Tests written first (red-green-refactor)
- [ ] **Structured Output**: Both JSON and human-readable formats supported
- [ ] **Incremental Delivery**: Features broken into independently deliverable user stories (P1=P2=P3+)
- [ ] **Documentation as Code**: README, CLAUDE.md, ADRs, inline docstrings

**Technology Standards Compliance**:
- [ ] Language version aligns with constitution (Python 3.11+, or equivalent for other languages)
- [ ] Dependency management follows standards (uv preferred, virtual environments mandatory)
- [ ] Complexity limits respected (file size <300 lines, function <100 lines, cyclomatic <25)

**Quality Gates** (must pass before implementation):
- [ ] Constitution Check: ✓ (this section)
- [ ] Linting: Configured (black, isort, ruff for Python; equivalent for other languages)
- [ ] Tests: Framework selected, >80% coverage target set
- [ ] Security: Secret scanning, vulnerability scanning configured
- [ ] Documentation: Structure defined (README, quickstart, examples)

**Violations**: If any principle cannot be followed, document in Complexity Tracking section below with justification.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
